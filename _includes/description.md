The PLaST research group in the
[Department of Informatics and Telecommunications](http://www.di.uoa.gr)
at the [University of Athens](http://www.uoa.gr) focuses on applied programming languages and software
engineering:

* Language mechanisms for abstraction (declarative languages, program
  generation, DSLs, modules and components, generics, extensible
  languages, multi-paradigm programming)
* Languages and tools for systems (programming models for concurrency,
  language support for distributed computing, memory management and
  program locality)
* Program analysis and testing (pointer analysis, automatic test
  generation, invariant inference, symbolic execution)
